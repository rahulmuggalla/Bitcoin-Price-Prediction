# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
Bitcoin is a decentralized network and digital currency that uses a peer-to-peer system to verify and process transactions. I will introduce you to a machine learning project on Bitcoin price prediction with Python.
Recently Bitcoin has received a lot of attention from the media and the public due to its recent price hike. As Bitcoin has been viewed as a financial asset and is traded through many cryptocurrency exchanges like a stock market, many researchers have studied various factors that affect the price of Bitcoin and the patterns behind its ï¬‚uctuations using various analytical and predictive methods.
Several predictive methods have been studied and compared for the task bitcoin price prediction using machine learning. In this article, I will be using the Facebook Prophet model for the task of Bitcoin price prediction using machine learning with Python.
The Facebook Prophet Library is an open-source additive regression model made available by Facebook for time-series predictions. While there is a more advanced version of the Prophet like NeuralProphet which is based on neural networks, I will be using the simplified version which uses machine learning techniques for the Bitcoin price prediction task. If you want to know more about how the Facebook Prophet template works
